# Data Analysis Summary

## Introduction
This data analysis project explores the dataset containing information about taxi data data. The analysis covers data collection, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Data Overview
The dataset consists of the following columns:

        Tip amount, automatically populated for credit card tips. Cash tips not included.

- **Tolls_amount**:
        Total amount of all tolls paid during the trip.

- **Total_amount**:
        Total amount charged to passengers, excluding cash tips.

 ### taxi zone data

- **LocationID:** Unique identifier for a specific location or taxi zone.
- **Borough:** Administrative division of the location (e.g., Manhattan, Brooklyn).
- **Zone:** Specific area or zone within the borough.
- **service_zone:** Additional categorization related to the service provided in the zone.


# Data Modeling
fact tables and dimension tables are key components of a star schema or snowflake schema design. These concepts are commonly used in data modeling to organize and structure data for efficient querying and analysis. Let me explain each:
## Fact Table:
A fact table contains quantitative data (facts) that can be analyzed. It typically consists of numeric measures, often called metrics, and foreign keys that link to dimension tables.
Fact tables are usually large and contain transactional data.
In the context of your taxi trip data, a fact table might contain measures like trip_distance, fare_amount, tip_amount, etc.

## Dimension Table:
A dimension table contains descriptive attributes that provide context to the data in the fact table.
Dimension tables are usually smaller in size compared to fact tables.
They contain categorical data and are often used for filtering and grouping in analysis.
In the context of your taxi trip data, dimension tables might include tables for Vendor, Location (pickup and dropoff locations), RateCode, PaymentType, etc.

Dimension Tables:

Time Dimension:

        time_id (primary key)
        pickup_datetime (from tpep_pickup_datetime)
        dropoff_datetime (from tpep_dropoff_datetime)


Location Dimension:

        location_id (primary key)
        location_name (derived from the "Zone" column in the reference table)
        borough (derived from the "Borough" column in the reference table)
        service_zone (derived from the "service_zone" column in the reference table)

Payment Type Dimension:

        payment_type_id (primary key)
        payment_type_name (from payment_type)

Rate Code Dimension:

        rate_code_id (primary key)
        rate_code_description (from RatecodeID)

Vendor Dimension:

        vendor_id (primary key)
        vendor_name (from VendorID)

Fact Table:

Trip Fact:

        trip_id (primary key)
        time_id (foreign key referencing Time Dimension)
        location_pickup_id (foreign key referencing Location Dimension for pickup)
        location_dropoff_id (foreign key referencing Location Dimension for dropoff)
        passenger_count
        trip_distance
        rate_code_id (foreign key referencing Rate Code Dimension)
        store_and_fwd_flag
        payment_type_id (foreign key referencing Payment Type Dimension)
        fare_amount
        extra
        mta_tax
        tip_amount
        tolls_amount
        improvement_surcharge
        total_amount
        congestion_surcharge
        airport_fee

This dimensional model follows a star schema, where the fact table (Trip Fact) is surrounded by dimension tables. Each dimension table contains descriptive attributes related to a specific aspect of the data, and the fact table contains quantitative data that can be analyzed.
